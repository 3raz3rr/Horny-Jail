changes:
  - bugfix: "The shake animation, jiggle animation, squish animation, jitter animation, and float animation, have all been fixed."
  - bugfix: "This also means that storage animations are fully working again. It's been a few years!"
  - bugfix: "The pull animation no longer interrupts ongoing animations."
  - tweak: "The pull animation now supports diagonal directions (currently only applies to the initial grab! pull code is spaghetti)"
  - bugfix: "All screenshake sources now fully support the screenshake pref"
  - code_imp: "cit_screenshake.dm has been fully merged into the base files."
  - bugfix: "You can no longer remotely apply fingerprints to storage objects by clicking and dragging it around. Additionally, storage objects now rustle again when clicking and dragging (only took like,, a year to fix)"
  - bugfix: "The pickup animation now properly slides into your spaceman again, instead of just kinda disappearing."
  - tweak: When pulling a resting mob, they'll now skip the laying animation entirely, fixing a visual oddity where they shrink and grow to flip.
  - tweak: Alerts are now a little snappier and bouncier, as they've been swapped from sine easing, to back easing.
  - tweak: Radial menus now use sine easing, rather than linear easing. This just looks a little prettier.
  - tweak: Runechat now properly respects an object's X offset. Previously, it relied on a hardcoded check for dogborgs.
  - tweak: The float animation now uses pixel_z instead of pixel_y, fixing issues where the Y offset gets wiped due to the float animation. This also makes floating fully compatible with ctrl+WASD."
