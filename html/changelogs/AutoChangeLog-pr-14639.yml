  - rscadd: "Cybernetic organs have been adjusted into three tiers: 1 (basic), 2 (standard, better than organic) and 3 (absolutely better than organic but expensive to print)"
  - rscadd: "Cybernetic organs that are emp'd instead suffer different effects based on the severity of the emp. The bigger the emp, the worse the effect is."
  - rscadd: "Rather than outright bricking, severely emp'd cyberorgans degrade over time very quickly, requiring replacement in the near future."
