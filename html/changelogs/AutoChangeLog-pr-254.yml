changes:
  - tweak: you'll no longer create a new verification entry if you already linked
      your discord, and It'll show the id of your current account instead
  - tweak: Makes it so discord links don't count for join checks if the `valid` field
      is 0
  - tweak: You'll wanna make sure you _stay_ in the discord server if you want to
      play, btw
