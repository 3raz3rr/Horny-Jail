changes:
  - rscadd: Telescience now has a fancy interface.
  - rscdel: Deletes the old interface.
  - balance: Telescience can no longer work without bluespace (why could it after
      all?).
  - refactor: Changed a lot of telescience code (it is still very spaghetti code,
      but a bit better).
