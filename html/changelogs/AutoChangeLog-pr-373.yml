changes:
  - tweak: Now size normalizers will continuously normalize you and absorb the effect
      of size changing mechanics in-game. Giving you all of the changes back when
      you take off the clothing
  - bugfix: Now you can actually give your character numbers in their names and species
  - bugfix: Gives the syntech ring and band an actual ring path so they can be attached
      to gloves (doesn't work if you use them this way tho)
  - bugfix: Definitely fixes the bug where spawning with more than one size normalizer
      locks you on size one _in case it still exists_
  - bugfix: Fixes a bug with nanites, probably Â¿
  - code_imp: Makes the size normalizer code less snowflakey and now relies on a component
