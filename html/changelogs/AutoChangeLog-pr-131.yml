changes:
  - tweak: Changed Hypnotic Stupor quirk to only reapply a trance after a minimum
      amount of time from a previous hypnosis
  - bugfix: Hypnosis phrase should now be properly escaped for regex (e.g. dangling
      parentheses)
  - config: Added configs for Hypnotic Stupor quirk tweaks (defaults on with a minimum
      hypnosis duration between 10 and 20 minutes)
