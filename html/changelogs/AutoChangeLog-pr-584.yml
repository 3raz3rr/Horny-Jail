  - code_imp: Rewrites "Set Gender" for simple mobs and silicon as an upward proc
      for "mob/living", while makes previous verbs to call for the proc instead. While
      it'll help with verbs now sharing the same function (and thus easier to edit),
      I am not sure if it will help with duplicate code.
