changes: 
  - refactor: "Dispenser: Adds the ability to store a small amount of reagents in the machine itself for dispensing. Reacting recipies cannot be stored. Size of storage increases with bin size."
  - refactor: "Dispenser: Allows reagents to be color coded by pH"
  - refactor: "Dispenser: Each reagent displays it's pH on hover"
  - refactor: "Dispenser: Allows the user to toggle between buttons and a radial dial"
  - refactor: "Dispenser: When the dispencer is upgraded it can dispense 5/3/2/1 volumes based on rating refactor: Dispenser: as it was before. This does not break recorded recipes."
  - tweak: "Adds a round function to some numbers so they're not huge"
  - tweak: "The Chem master can now get purity for all reagents when analysed"
  - bugfix: "Synthissue fixes"
  - tweak: "buffers now have a strong and weak variant. Weak can be dispensed, and strong can be created. Strong buffers are 6x more effective."
  - bugfix: "Some buffer pH edge calculation fixes"
