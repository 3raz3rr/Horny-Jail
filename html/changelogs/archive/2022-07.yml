  Bhijn & Myr:
  - code_imp: Barks can now be intercepted via component signals. Both bark queuing
      and individual barks can be intercepted via signals!
  - rscadd: The "Brassy" bark has been added, using the cog installation sound as
      a sample! This works surprisingly well as a bark
  - rscadd: 'Genetics can now give people goose1.ogg tweak: If new barks are queued
      before the current barks are finished, this will interrupt all ongoing barks
      tweak: Yelling no longer cuts the minimum bark time variance down to half, as
      this proved to sound pretty awful with most barks. tweak: Chitter now uses a
      completely unique audio sample, which is based on the original ratchet.ogg it
      used to be. This new sample is shorter, and has significantly less harsh noise
      on the higher frequencies, making it much easier on the ears. Additionally,
      the minimum speed for chitter has been reduced from 6 to 4. tweak: Setting vocal_bark
      to a file should now automatically turn it into a sound datum (in theory, at
      least! as of writing i haven''t tested this at all)'
  - bugfix: Barks and other DNA features after the first mob color now work exactly
      as you'd expect. This was the cause for horrid eldritch bark sounds when the
      wrong part of DNA gets hit. The first mob color has lost some genetics resolution
      as an indirect result of this (the higher resolution is what caused this bug)
  UDaV73rus, Tokoriso, dragomagol:
  - rscadd: welding now has an animation!

  timothyteakettle:
  - rscadd: slimes no longer die from having no blood, properly consume limbs when
      at low blood, and suffer brute damage and oxygen loss for having no blood and
      no limbs left to consume respectably, they cannot go past BLOOD_VOLUME_MAXIMUM
      from consuming toxin
