changes:
  - tweak: Makes it so ooc notes always appear (just so people can see your erp prefs)
      even if empty, the only exception is having your face covered.
  - bugfix: You should no longer always see people's flavor texts (if they were visible)
      while they are masked or something, didn't really notice anything before but
      just to make sure.
