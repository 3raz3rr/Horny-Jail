changes: 
  - code_imp: "Barks can now be intercepted via component signals. Both bark queuing and individual barks can be intercepted via signals!"
  - rscadd: "The \"Brassy\" bark has been added, using the cog installation sound as a sample! This works surprisingly well as a bark"
  - rscadd: "Genetics can now give people goose1.ogg
tweak: If new barks are queued before the current barks are finished, this will interrupt all ongoing barks
tweak: Yelling no longer cuts the minimum bark time variance down to half, as this proved to sound pretty awful with most barks.
tweak: Chitter now uses a completely unique audio sample, which is based on the original ratchet.ogg it used to be. This new sample is shorter, and has significantly less harsh noise on the higher frequencies, making it much easier on the ears. Additionally, the minimum speed for chitter has been reduced from 6 to 4.
tweak: Setting vocal_bark to a file should now automatically turn it into a sound datum (in theory, at least! as of writing i haven't tested this at all)"
  - bugfix: "Barks and other DNA features after the first mob color now work exactly as you'd expect. This was the cause for horrid eldritch bark sounds when the wrong part of DNA gets hit. The first mob color has lost some genetics resolution as an indirect result of this (the higher resolution is what caused this bug)"
