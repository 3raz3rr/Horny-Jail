changes: 
  - rscadd: "Jukeboxes now have a queue! You can pay 40 credits to have any song of your choosing queued up for playback on the jukebox!"
  - rscadd: "Jukeboxes can now be emagged, allowing you to boost their volume up to 210%, along with removing all of its access restrictions. Additionally, a sufficiently loud jukebox is fully capable of causing potentially permanent damage to your ears."
  - rscadd: "Jukeboxes now support multi-z! This is self-explanatory.
tweak: Volume knobs now work on jukeboxes!
tweak: Muffled jukeboxes have been given a buff.
tweak: Sounds now factor in the distance multiplier for their baseline z offset.
tweak: SOUND_UPDATE now bypasses the can_hear() check in playsound_local() (thanks Azarak for helping figure this out!)"
  - bugfix: "Jukebox audio no longer uses playsound_local(), allowing falloff to properly apply to jukeboxes (this fixes the bug where they were significantly quieter than intended)
tweak: When deaf, jukeboxes no longer mute the playing track permanently."
  - bugfix: "Ears are capable of taking damage again."
  - rscadd: "Jukeboxes have been added to Boxstation, Lambdastation, Metastation, and Omegastation"
