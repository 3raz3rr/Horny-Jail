changes:
  - rscadd: Platings can be removed from the floor (currently only certain ones),
      just examine it to know if you can or not, and how to.
  - tweak: Trying to place a tile on an asteroid turf, such as lavaland's, will no
      longer place a regular tile and instead place plating first.
