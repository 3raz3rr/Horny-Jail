changes:
  - tweak: Hydration gained from liquids will now be multiplied by the time they've
      been in you, so that might reduce the amount of clicks.
  - bugfix: Bleeding will no longer make you dry and being hydrated is extra beneficial
      against blood loss.
  - bugfix: It appears that only water gave you hydration? whoops.
